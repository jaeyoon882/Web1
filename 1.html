    <h2>What is backend development?</h2>
    <img src="programming.jpg" width="60%",>
    <p>Backend web development is the part of web development 
    that deals with the <strong><u>server-side</u> of a web application</strong>. 
    This includes creating and managing the server-side logic, connecting the application to a database,
    creating server-side APIs, handling user authentication and authorization, and processing and responding to user requests.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">A backend developer is responsible for the development of server-side components of a web application
    working with databases, handling requests, creating server-side APIs that can be consumed by frontend developers to retrieve and manipulate data,
    ensuring the scalability of the systems i.e. making sure that the backend can handle a high volume of traffic and is performant, 
    integrating external services like payment gateways, message queues, cloud services, etc.</p>
